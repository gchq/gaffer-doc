| Vertex            | In Gaffer, a vertex is the id of an entity. Note that a vertex can exist on an edge without an associated entity. Any querying will only show these vertices on their associated edges |
| Node              | A node is what Gaffer calls an entity |
| Properties        | A property is a key/value pair that stores data on both edges and entities |
| Element           | The word is used to describe edges or entities |
| Stores            | A Gaffer store represents the backing database responsbile for storing or facilitating access to a graph |
| Operations        | An operation is an instruction / function that you send to the API to manipulate and query a graph |
| Matched vertex    | `matchedVertex` is a field added to Edges which are returned by Gaffer queries, stating whether your seeds matched the source or destination |
| Python            | A programming language that is used to build applications. Gaffer uses Python to interact with the API |
| Java              | A object oriented programming language used to build software. Gaffer is primarily built in Java |
| Database          | A database is a collection of organised structured information or data typically stored in a computer system |
| API               | Application Programming Interface. An API is for one or more services / systems to communicate with each other |
